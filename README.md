# BANDPLAY.IO

An ownerless music platform, a mesh of quasi-independent, artist coupled tracks within a profit-sharing community. 
Bandplay uses Arweave network to solve real-music problems for artists, bands, and labels from all sizes, for global and local fans.
We are laying the foundation of a decentralised music industry creating value, and leading the way towards a regenerative business model. And all it's anchored on the Arweave blockchain network.
We will constantly experiment with new ways of increasing revenue and satisfaction for musicians and fans.
Because we will flip the music industry upside down again.

## Intro

It's time to get to know the Bandplay mesh.
Bandplay is a disruptive music platform in which tracks, musicians and fans are in the center of the decentralised music community. A community in which every token holder participates in the governance and profits generated. 
And so everyone is a stakeholder and working to help those community members around them succeed.
