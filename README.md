# BANDPLAY.IO

An ownerless music platform, a mesh of artists and fans empowered by a profit-sharing community.

Arweave - Disrupt the Music Industry Hackathon Winner üèÜ

## About

Bandplay is an ownerless music platform that is laying the foundation for a decentalized music industry.
We are built on top of the Arweave network which enables us to have decentralized, permanent, and immutable data storage.

By creating a peer-to-peer music distribution platform, we are able to provide fair compensation to artists by cutting out centralized structures that gate keep the industry.
We have also implemented a form of community governance through the use of profit sharing tokens.
Owners of these tokens will in turn own part of Bandplay, and be able to collect a stream of micro-dividends, vote on product decisions, and purchase music.

## Features

### Account

1. Musicians and fans can **update their avatar** via [ArweaveID V2](https://arca-arweave.github.io/arweave-id-v2-ui) 
It's _optional not required_ to upload or tip tracks.
2. Musicians can **customize their permaweb page** with a custom header, and links to their website and social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. It's _optional not required_ to create releases and upload tracks.
